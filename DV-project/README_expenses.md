# 📊 Construction Expense Visualizer

Hi! I'm **Divyan Choudhary**, a B.Tech CSE student with a keen interest in **data science, data analysis, and visualization**.  
This is one of my early projects where I built an interactive dashboard using Jupyter Notebook to track and analyze construction expenses for two projects — 🏠 House and 🏢 Studio.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

This dashboard lets you explore:
- 📅 Monthly spending patterns  
- 🧾 Who paid how much  
- 💳 Mode of payment (Cash / Online / Cheque)  
- 📊 Visuals like bar charts, pie charts, trend lines, and heatmaps

Everything is interactive and designed to give you a clear view of how the money flows!

## ✅ What’s Inside
- `expense_dashboard.ipynb` – The main notebook with all code and charts  
- `requirements.txt` – Python libraries needed to run the notebook  
- `README.md` – You're reading it 🙂

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Run all the cells and interact with the dashboard!

## 💡 Why I Built This

As someone exploring **data science**, I wanted to build something practical and visual. This dashboard gave me hands-on experience with:
- Cleaning and organizing data
- Building interactive widgets
- Plotting meaningful visualizations

It's a simple start, but it helped me apply my learning in a real-world context.
